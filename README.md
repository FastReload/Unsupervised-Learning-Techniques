# Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques
- This project was done as a part of a Data Mining Techniques course during my Master's Degree at UC - Riverside.
- This contains k-means clustering, Density-based clustering with DBSCAN, Graph-based clustering with Spectral Clustering and Anomaly detection with the Isolation Forest implementations from scratch without using Scikit-Learn.
- All descriptions of implementations have been provided within the Jupyter notebook.
